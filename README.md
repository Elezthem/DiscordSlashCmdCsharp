# DiscordSlashCmdCsharp
C# + Discord.net + SlashCommand

In this example, a Discord bot is created that responds to the slash command **/hello** by sending the message "Hello!" in response.

Make sure to replace **YOUR_BOT_TOKEN** with your actual bot token.

This example uses Discord.Net version 3.1.1. Please make sure you have the correct version of the library installed using NuGet.
